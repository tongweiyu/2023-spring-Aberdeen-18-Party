## Introduction

* #### App project's goal

    College students who want to add more social activities after school. The range of activities can be unlimited,  and you can choose to join in any activities(of course legal).    

* #### App project's scope

    We developed this app to help college students quickly recruit partners and make more friends. Nowadays many college students complain about they can't find wonderful activities or opportunities to improve themselves because of their shyness, or because they have no ball friends, dinner partners, study partners. Our Party APP was created for that.

    ​    

## **Requirements Specification**:

* #### User requirements

    Through our survey during development, we find out three part that users pay most attention to the three parts including the UI design, the customizability of the app and the security of the app.

      

* #### Functional requirements

​		   You can matching your favorite "Party" at once and release the "Party" you have interest in. In addition the security of the app should be welly ensured which can won't reveal their private data and give them safety guarantee.



## Overall Design

* #### the structure of the app

​		Our "Party" is mainly composed of three parts, the main page, adding, setting these three big sections, to meet the needs and goals of the software system and users. Our products include land registration page, home page, the navigation bar at the bottom of the parts, etc

* #### primary functions of the app

​		Our products include landing registration page, main page, bottom navigation bar and many other parts. At the same time, it includes a variety of graphics, text, buttons, etc. that the user interacts with the software system, which is used to receive user input and display system output. Security and error handling, protect data security includes the software system and the mechanism of handling errors. This includes user authentication, data encryption, exception handling, and more (still in progress). Configuration and management, including configuration management, deployment and maintenance of the software system. Software installation, update, and logging are involved.



## User Interface Design

  In the design of the User interface we choose the combination of the dark color to give users a better  vision. We mainly have five parts including login and registration, choosing interface, main interface, adding interface and setting interface.




## Key Technologies

   In the designing of the app, we  have faced lots of problem like how to design the register interface, how to design the bottom navigation, how to realize our UI design in the code. The main problem is the data transmission.  How to communicate between different components of an application and even with other applications is our main problem. We tried to use the BroadcastReceiver to receive broadcast data. And register the broadcast receiver then send broadcast.

  Another key technology is about the user safety, but now we are still try for it. Using appropriate encryption algorithms to encrypt sensitive data, such as user login credentials, profile information, etc.  Android offers a variety of encryption libraries and APIs, such as the Android Keystore system, which can be used to securely store and process encryption keys and sensitive data



## Testing and User Experience Analysis

* #### testing on the third-party cloud platform

​	  In the testing of the app, we found out that most type of the phone can have a great experience in our app testing. We have nearly 90% of the success rate. We can take an example of the HUAWEI P50, the CPU occupancy of our app is really low which nearly 0%. Besides, the memory usage of our app is 54mb which is a small number.

* #### User Experience

​	  We invite 10 person to join in our app developing process from stage1 to stage3 and here are some typical comment of them.

Stage 1: The proposal is attractive to me. This project may solve my excessively autistic college life.

Stage 2: Interface design is so cool, but the color I think is too gloomy, maybe the light color department I prefer.

Stage 3: The functional implementation is still not complete ah, but compared to stage 2, there has been enough progress, interface design and switching logic has also been well improved.

Stage 1: The idea is good, but there are still many areas that are not clear.

Stage 2: Interface design is good, if you can give me a custom color interface in the future.

Stage 3: Functional implementation is still not complete ah, I am more satisfied with the interface design.

 

## Conclusion

  Overall it is a great challenge for group, in the process of practice, we have felt the joy in achieving results. At the same time, I feel the gap between reality and ideal. There are still many key functions that have not been learned and practiced, and I hope to complete them in the future.

* #### Complement of function

* #### Customer follow-up survey

* #### Enrich the overall experience

    ### What we got

* #### About teamwork

    In terms of team cooperation, whether it is the collision of thinking when discussing project innovation with teammates, the similarities and differences in our aesthetics when designing interface, or our mutual help in the process of code implementation, these all enhance my understanding of the team. Let us better participate in team cooperation and integrate into the team in the future. In the process of team cooperation, we also had differences, which also required us to communicate and exchange, so in addition to the progress of technology, we think the most important thing is my progress in language communication. 

* #### Knowledge and experience

    This semester curriculum project practice, and is a complete process of development practice. This helps us to understand in advance the complete process of a project from idea proposal to product development to product release. Whether it is product testing or grabbing a random sample of students for feedback, these processes are closer to the real product development process. We felt that a relatively complete process was originally practiced in this way. 

* #### Progress in coding

    This semester, I am learning a brand new language Kotlin. Compared with the previous Java and python, we have a brand new experience in both the unpredictable Android Studio editor and its concise syntax. Due to the limited teaching time and the unusual errors of Android Studio, we do a lot of research and study on the Internet, which helps us to better use the Internet to learn skills.
